This program is an encryption and decryption tool that allows users to input a password and encrypt or decrypt messages. It uses a simple substitution cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages, and keeps track of recent messages in separate lists for encrypted and decrypted messages. Users can also view recent messages by entering their password.
